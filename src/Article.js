          Desperate times like pandemics have been historically known to compel
          citizens to look to their leaders for guidance and support. A notice
          from cholera-hit Prussia in the 1830s reads ‘what you have to do is
          trust in the authorities and obey what the authorities say’. The world
          is currently seeing a similar turn of events where people are being
          compelled to blindly trust their leaders in the absence of an
          alternative. However, the question that this raises is can this trust
          be misused ?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is even more relevant when we note that the current pandemic has
          resulted in 84 countries declaring a ‘state of emergency’, which
          curtails the democratic rights of individuals as well as establishing
          systems to ensure better surveillance of activities. While these
          restrictions are needed in order to slow the advancement of Covid-19,
          the concentration of power has already resulted in instances of its
          abuse. For instance, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has
          declared an indefinite state of emergency that allows him to rule by
          decree and imprison individuals preventively for up to five years.
          Further, the surveillance data that is currently being collected to
          combat the spread of the virus could potentially be misused even after
          the pandemic has passed. If our past experience with privacy issues
          were to serve as a precedent, it is not unreasonable to assume that
          personal data could be easily compromised.

        <h1>Why authoritarianism?</h1>
        <p>
          Authoritarian trends often accompany national emergencies like the
          current crisis because the executive needs to act quickly and
          therefore curtail several procedural requirements that ensure
          accountability in ordinary circumstances. For instance, several
          countries including The Gambia and Israel have suspended or restricted
          parliamentary deliberations. Further, as noted earlier, citizens are a
          lot more dependent on their leaders during emergency situations, which
          often translates to them having a higher propensity to renounce their
          democratic rights in exchange for protection and effective action. It
          is this very Hobbesian power dynamic that has allowed governments to
          easily implement surveillance programmes that severely hinder the
          privacy rights of citizens. For example, thousands of people in India
          have downloaded the government’s surveillance mobile app Aarogya Setu
          despite the lack of transparency on how the data collected is going to
          be used.

            Patriotic calls to action have urged people to accept the emergency
            powers being exercised by populist leaders.
          </h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          It is also important to note that contesting abuses of power in
          emergency situations like the COVID-19 pandemic is an incredibly
          daunting task. Mass protests or demonstrations against such instances
          are implausible given the current restrictions on assembly and
          non-essential movement. Further, an international outcry against
          leaders misusing the pandemic to advance their own agendas is also
          unlikely given that international organisations and global powers are
          largely consumed with the pressing problem of containing the virus.
          The fact that the spread of the pandemic came at a time when populism
          was rising globally has also made it easier for populist leaders to
          capture power. Populism has often been associated with politicians
          projecting themselves as the ‘sole saviours’ of the ordinary masses.
          This kind of narrative that results in an unmediated connection
          between the leader and his people has become commonplace in the way
          politicians are combatting the coronavirus. For instance, Prime
          Minister Narendra Modi has launched a relief fund for affected people
          called PM Cares, putting himself and the office of Prime Minister at
          the centre of the fight against the virus. Further, all major
          decisions related to the crisis are being virtually announced by Modi
          – no other minister, bureaucrat or party official is communicating any
          significant policy information. This has helped him become the
          exclusive representative of the people and has resulted in the
          centralisation of power in his hands. Further, populists have been
          known to use emotional appeals by highlighting the fears and anxieties
          of people in order to mobilise support . This strategy is also being
          used by leaders who refer to the health crisis as a ‘war’ that
          requires the ‘sacrifice’ of the people. The use of such patriotic
          calls to action have urged people to accept the emergency powers being
          exercised by populist leaders.
        </p>
        <h1>Is authoritarianism here to stay?</h1>
        <p>
          While authoritarian abuses of power have been enabled by the pandemic,
          the situation is not entirely hopeless. There is reason to believe
          that, in the longer scheme of events, democratic principles will
          prevail. While emergencies can scare the public in the short term, the
          ongoing Black Lives Matter protests worldwide are testimony to
          people’s commitment to the values of equality, justice and freedom.
          Moreover, several reports have shown that despite the current appeal
          for authoritarian strict actions, combatting the pandemic will require
          extreme levels of transparency from governments. The state needs to be
          honest with its citizens and share realistic predictions of the future
          in order to prepare them for the difficult times that lie ahead. This
          will ensure that lockdown conditions are executed smoothly and people
          have some notice to make plans about their accommodation and finances.
          It is the citizenry’s trust in their leaders that will determine the
          success of norms like ‘social distancing’ without opposition and
          resistance. This is naturally more likely to be found in democracies
          as opposed to authoritarian systems.

            The current crisis will likely expose the chinks in the armour of
            authoritarian regimes in the long run.
          </h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          Further, populism as an enabling factor for authoritarianism could
          also weaken in the long run. Populists have reportedly been
          mishandling the pandemic globally as they have felt the pressure to
          downplay the dangers of the virus in order to continue the appeasement
          of the masses that their popularity depends on. For example, President
          Donald Trump has kept insisting that the US has the disease under
          control and that the epidemic will disappear shortly. Such platitudes
          have resulted in the healthcare system and general population of the
          US being vastly underprepared for the severity with which COVID-19 has
          hit the country. Instances like these reveal the systematic dangers of
          populism and are likely to cause people’s disillusionment with
          populist leaders. Therefore, while authoritarian trends have been
          augmented during the global healthcare crisis, there are optimistic
          signs that point towards the revival of democratic principles in the
          aftermath of coronavirus. The current crisis will likely expose the
          chinks in the armour of authoritarian regimes in the long run as
          people come to realise the virtues of transparency and trust.
